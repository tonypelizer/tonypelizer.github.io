      <h2>Hi there!</h2>
      <p>
        I’m a software engineer at <a
          href="https://dairyone.com"
          target="_blank"
          rel="noopener noreferrer">Dairy One</a
        >, where I build systems and tools that support everyday, production
        use, with a focus on reliability and long-term maintainability. I
        currently work remotely from a small town in Vermont.

      <h6>ABOUT</h6>

      <p>
        I’ve been building things on the web since childhood, starting with
        HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a shared family computer. That early
        curiosity grew into a long-term interest in how software actually
        behaves once it’s in real use.
      </p>

      <p>
        My background is a mix of formal study and hands-on learning. I studied
        computer science at community college and later at the University of New
        Hampshire, and I’ve continued learning primarily by building, shipping,
        and maintaining real systems.
      </p>

      <p>
        Outside of work, I’m a husband and a dad. We also have a dog and a cat.
        I enjoy spending time outdoors, playing music, reading science fiction,
        rock climbing, woodworking, and occasional target practice.
      </p>
